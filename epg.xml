    <desc lang="en">Was it time for James Franklin to go at Penn State? On this episode of Others Receiving Votes, Sports Illustrated's Pat Forde and Bryan Fischer are joined by former longtime College Gameday Reporter Gene Wojciechowski to break down the firing of Penn State Head Coach James Franklin after the teams loss to Northwestern, their third straight. They also breakdown whether Penn State is in position to be a championship contender in the Big Ten and for the College Football National Championship before giving their thoughts on who Penn State should turn to next, bringing up Curt Cignetti of Indiana and the tough choice he could have this offseason. After that, they give out their Midseason Awards for Heisman, Flop, Surprise, Coach and Team of the half season while also talking about some of the dumbest ideas that were brought up by the masses during the first half of the college football season. They finish things off with a view at some of the big games this weekend, giving their picks and some background on each matchup including a few games that could have College Football Playoff implications in USC vs. Notre Dame, BYU vs. Utah and Alabama vs. Tennessee.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) is a brilliant scientist obsessed with perfecting virtual reality software. When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute – Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener. Dr. Angelo's goal is to benefit his human guinea pig and ultimately mankind itself, but evil lurks the guise of "the Shop," a shadowy group that seeks to use the technology to create an invincible war machine. When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for the control of Jobe's mind and the future of the world.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Don't sleep on the summer panfish bite! The lion's share of panfishing occurs during the springtime when the fish are concentrated in the shallow waters and also in the winter, but summertime can be absolutely fantastic for bluegill and crappie. Just like other gamefish, they can make dramatic seasonal movements and you'll need to find them first before you can catch them. Today, we're joined by panfish aficionado Joel Nelson.</desc>
