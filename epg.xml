Oscar®-winner* Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) is Andy, an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke, Training Day), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering clash that may obliterate their already precarious lives.</desc>

Jeffrey's vow of chastity is inspired by a fear of AIDS, a prospect which has started to terrify him so much that he decides he'd be better off never making love again. He is happy and relieved for a time, until he meets Steve, a handsome, charming dreamboat who also happens to be HIV-positive. Jeffrey wants nothing more than to be with Steve, but his anxiety over the disease and fear of commitment stand in the way.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Four of the Apocalypse, director Lucio Fulci delivers a gritty and haunting Spaghetti Western. After a crooked sheriff banishes four misfits—a gambler, a prostitute, a drunk, and a simple-minded man—they journey across a lawless frontier searching for survival and redemption. But their path collides with a sadistic bandit, plunging them into violence, cruelty, and despair. Blending raw brutality with moments of tenderness, this bleak tale explores the struggle for humanity in a world gone savage.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Louisiana Catch and Cook</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this episode, Chef Jay Ducote brings along a very special fishing buddy, his dad, for our first-ever Catch &amp; Cook freshwater adventure! We’re heading to the legendary Toledo Bend, famous for its sac-a-lait (Cajun for crappie) and ranked among the top bass lakes in the U.S. It’s a bucket-list stop for anglers everywhere, but trust us, the story doesn’t end with the fish.

Steeped in Spanish, French, and Native American roots dating back to the Louisiana Purchase, this region serves up culture and flavor as rich as its fishing. We’ll be staying at Wildwood Resort, hitting the water with Captain Matt Loetscher of Living The Dream Guide Service, and capping off the day with spectacular lake views from their breezy lakeside bar.
Hook, line, and sinker — you don’t want to miss this one!

    <desc lang="en">In this episode we’re headed down to the fishing village of Shell Beach in St. Bernard Parish for a full Louisiana experience!
Joining us is Chef Lynnae Oxley, a chef from the Pacific Northwest who once beat our own Jay Ducote on Food Network’s Chopped.
On the way, we make a pit stop at the iconic Abita Brewery on Tchoupitoulas in New Orleans, then grab lunch and cook up some classic hog’s head cheese at Jeanfreau’s Meat Market.
From there, it’s all about the water — trout and redfish with Captain Don, crawfish and crabs with Captain Sal, followed by the ultimate Louisiana feast as we cook up our fresh catch at the Gotcha Hooked Lodge’s outdoor kitchen.
It’s fishing, food, and culture — served up Bayou style!

    <desc lang="en">In this episode we’re joined by Professional angler, Nicole Jacobs, and we head down to “Fishing Capital of the World” Venice, Louisiana. Nestled where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico, Venice is a true paradise for anglers. 
 
We kick things off at Le Matidora Inn with an airboat ride down the Mississippi River before heading offshore to chase tuna, red snapper, and mahi-mahi. After a full day on the water, we return to Cypress Cove Marina to turn the fresh catch into a waterfront feast.

What begins as a case of black market cigarettes soon involves military weapons, 100-dollar counterfeit bills and drugs, all entering US ports undetected.

After receiving Rolex watches and other gifts, Calverese and the FBI do a takedown of the wedding guests.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Royal Charm: Smuggler's Blues</title>
    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Lou Calverese goes undercover to infiltrate the lucrative world of international smuggling. What begins as a case of black market cigarettes soon involves military weapons, 100-dollar counterfeit bills and drugs, all entering US ports undetected. Calverese comes up with a brilliant take-down scheme to nab everyone involved in the smuggling - a personal invitation to his fabricated wedding.

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Lou Calverese goes undercover to infiltrate the lucrative world of international smuggling. What begins as a case of black market cigarettes soon involves military weapons, 100-dollar counterfeit bills and drugs, all entering US ports undetected. Calverese comes up with a brilliant take-down scheme to nab everyone involved in the smuggling - a personal invitation to his fabricated wedding. After receiving Rolex watches and other gifts, Calverese and the FBI do a takedown of the wedding guests.</desc>
