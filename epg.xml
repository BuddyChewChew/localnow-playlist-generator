    <desc lang="en">In Episode 10 Boat Trader heads to central Texas to explore boating culture in the lone star state. Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc>
