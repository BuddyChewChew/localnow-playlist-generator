    <desc lang="en"> ATA 204: Vegas Preview, New Engagement Programs, and a Silly Pro Draft This week on Around the ACL, Meesh and Jake are joined by Athena for a packed episode that mixes league insight with some fun. We start with a look at new Player and Director Engagement Programs, where Athena shares what’s being built behind the scenes and how these initiatives aim to strengthen the ACL community at every level. From there, we preview the upcoming Las Vegas Open, breaking down both Singles and Doubles fields and what to watch as players head into another big event weekend. Athena also gives insight into Minor League Teams and what they mean for the league’s development pipeline. To keep things light, the crew wraps up with a Silly ACL Pro Draft, debating which pros you’d trust to plan your wedding, cook dinner, win a trivia night, dominate dodgeball, manage social media, or win a dance-off. As always, we close with bold predictions and quick takes in Hole-y Hot Take. A little news, a little preview, and a lot of personality in this one.</desc>
