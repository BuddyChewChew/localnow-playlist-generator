When word comes through with strict orders not to engage with the cartel, but to save any hostages they come across, the team must use all their training thus far to pull off this important recon operation.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wild Shots</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this episode of Wildshots, host Tim Harmsen heads to Sig Sauer for an exclusive look inside one of America’s most advanced firearms manufacturing facilities. With a motto of “Every day you wake up and get a little better,” Sig Sauer lives up to its words—producing over 5,000 firearms a day with cutting-edge robotics and precision automation. After a full factory tour, Tim hits Sig’s state-of-the-art testing range to get hands-on with the legendary XM250 machine gun, pushing the limits of modern firepower. Then it’s time for some pure shooting mastery as Tim meets up with friend and firearms influencer 22Plinkster. Known for his unbelievable accuracy and showmanship, 22Plinkster ups the ante—splitting playing cards with a .22 bullet, upside down, and even splitting a single bullet mid-flight to hit two separate targets at once. Finally, the episode caps off with a nod to Hollywood as Tim checks out the Genesis Arms machinery seen in John Wick, blending cinematic cool with real-world firepower.</desc>

He carries the baby to his friend's desolate, broken-down town; the friend has died, so Yang reopens a laundry and settles down, hanging wet clothes, growing flowers, raising the infant, and finding himself attracted to Lynne, a red-haired woman with a tragic past. As long as Yang keeps his sword sheathed, his rivals won't find him, but a band of reprobate gunmen terrorize the town and threaten Lynne. Showdowns are inevitable, but once the sword is drawn, can Yang find rest, a home, and a family?</desc>
