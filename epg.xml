    <desc lang="en">Definitely our wildest episode so far. Here’s the deal: Mt. Elgon is an 14,000 foot volcano in eastern Kenya.  We propose a safari/ascent of the dormant volcano. Here’s the first kicker: High on the the flanks of the volcano is Kitum Cave – a cave created by the most unique form of erosion – Elephant Erosion. For millennia elephants have been going into the cave to carve it out with their tusks in order to eat the salty rock. Here’s the second kicker: the cave is thought to be the home of the Ebola Marberg virus – the world’s most deadly virus. So here’s the plan: We are going enter the cave, at night, wearing full Bio-Hazard suits to protect us from the virus.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"For our second episode of Huckberry Homes, we set our sights on the Oregon coast and flew out to see our friends ‪@ben_moon‬ and Sophie Kuller. Tired of fixing up other people's houses, Ben decided to spend the last few years crafting his own house from the ground up, while getting help from his friends, Dad, and Sophie along the way. This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.

On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.

We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Good morning, everyone! Over the past few weeks, we've been soaking up the sun at Parer's Resort, nestled above Bishop, California, in the stunning Eastern Sierras. Our adventure kicked off with some thrilling pocket creek fishing. We then made our way to South Lake, where we spent a fantastic afternoon with Jared on the pontoon boat. Today, we're kicking off our adventure in the breathtaking surroundings of Lake Sabrina with Seth and Jared. We're venturing into the backcountry for a scenic hike to Long Lake—a first for us in this slice of paradise. Get ready for an unforgettable journey, as we're stoked on trout. Let's go fishing</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>
