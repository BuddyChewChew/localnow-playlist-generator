    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>

After settling into our comfortable cabin, we kicked off our adventure with some creek fishing.

But first, the All-Stars are split into teams for a searching mission, using Offgrid’s Faraday bags. Later, they’re introduced to the new ropes course, “The Odyssey”, to test their mental and physical fortitude, as well as their endurance, using a climbing wall. See who rises to the occasion and who suffers from "paralysis by over analysis” in this episode.</desc>

Following the competition, Don receives a call from the CIA: the mission is officially greenlit, and it’s time for the All-Stars to kick things into high gear. This moment marks a pivotal shift in their training, with lives now hanging in the balance. After a crash course in the classroom, the All-Stars head to the field for what they think is a land navigation exercise… but things quickly spiral when a group of aggressive hostiles ambushes and captures the competitors for an intense hostage training scenario. Will any of them make it out—and live to tell the tale?</desc>

Later, Nemo Arms ups the ante with a challenge featuring three of their firearms and a rugged desert terrain course of fire. Just as the contestants begin to wind down for the day, Olight steps in to illuminate the path to the next round of challenges.</desc>
