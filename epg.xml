    <desc lang="en">The stakes continue to climb as Green Light Sights rewards one top shooter with their very own custom weapon—proof that precision pays off. But there's no time to celebrate. Bear Arms ups the ante by issuing defense vests to every contestant, with one hard rule: once it’s on, it stays on. From grueling mission briefings to body armor plank challenges that push endurance to the brink, the weight—literally and mentally—never lets up. Still armored, the team reports to Ken Shamrock for another brutal dose of Lion’s Den physical punishment. Just when they think they’ve caught a break, Compliant Technologies’ infamous glove makes a shocking return to torment a fresh round of contestants. And as the day winds down, Don introduces the team to his personal “Flights” challenge—an unforgiving test no one is excited to take on. It all ends with a sobering CIA reminder: in the field, your backstory might just save your life—or end it.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">This week, memory meets mission as contestants face off in a high-stakes Kim’s Game challenge—designed to sharpen recall under pressure with 100 points and team leadership on the line. With observation, speed, and accuracy all in play, remembering every detail could make or break the mission. As the team pushes forward, it’s time to dig deeper. Contestants open up about their backstories, revealing the powerful personal reasons that brought them to the toughest reality show on earth. Some are here to prove something. Others? To fight for more than just themselves. The action intensifies as Hoffner Knives returns with a brutal tactical evolution, testing shooting and blade skills with precision under pressure. A split-second difference determines the winner of a major reward—proving that in this game, every tenth of a second matters. The day wraps with a visit from HCA Precision Barrels and one final classroom lesson—a pointed reminder that in the world of elite operators, your story is your strength… or your downfall.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The day kicks off with “The 1000-Yard Shot,” and the All-Stars are put to the test bright and early. Who will “make impact” and who will fall flat? Following the competition, Don receives a call from the CIA: the mission is officially greenlit, and it’s time for the All-Stars to kick things into high gear. This moment marks a pivotal shift in their training, with lives now hanging in the balance. After a crash course in the classroom, the All-Stars head to the field for what they think is a land navigation exercise… but things quickly spiral when a group of aggressive hostiles ambushes and captures the competitors for an intense hostage training scenario. Will any of them make it out—and live to tell the tale?</desc>
