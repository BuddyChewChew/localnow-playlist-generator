    <desc lang="en">Jeff Lindsey from The Lindsey Way is on a mission for one deer — a buck they call “Junior.” After passing him the year before, Jeff spends months trying to catch up with the elusive whitetail. He makes mistakes, second-guesses himself, and faces plenty of close calls. But exactly one year to the day after letting Junior walk, Jeff climbs back into the same stand — and this time, it all comes together.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The West Texas desert has a way of pulling you in. In Desert Ghost, Will Cooper heads west to Marathon, Texas, with longtime friend and mentor Cody Roberts to hunt aoudad in one of the most remote landscapes in the state. Rooted in family legacy, this film explores Cody’s deep ties to the desert, the story behind Desert Ghost Distillery, and the mystique of a western oasis near Big Bend National Park. More than a hunt, Desert Ghost dives into the role of aoudad management and its importance to desert bighorn sheep conservation efforts led by Texas Parks and Wildlife and the Wild Sheep Foundation. Sometimes, to protect what belongs here — you have to chase the ghosts. You really do have to be tough, determined, or one lucky bastard to make it out in West Texas.</desc>

Logan Chamberlain put together a massive weekend, capturing both Pro Singles and Pro Doubles alongside Gavin Cano, and the crew breaks down what made his performance so dominant. Jake, Meesh, and Cory recap everything from Signature #2 in Las Vegas, including standout runs across the divisions. We talk through Chamberlain’s incredible double win, the key moments in Singles, and how the rest of the field stacked up. We also hit the rest of the podiums from the weekend, including wins from Kamryn Belvin, Jay Dotson, Gabriel Clauson, and more across Women’s, Seniors, and Juniors competition. To wrap things up, we bring some Vegas energy with the Cornhole Olympics Medal Ceremony, handing out gold medals for the most entertaining moments of the event: Best facial expressions Best drip Who looked like they were having the most fun in Vegas Best crowd energy The ultimate “How Did That Not Go In?” shot Plus, we close the show with another round of Hole-y Hot Takes.
