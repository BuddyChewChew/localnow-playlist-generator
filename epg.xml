They mention who got the biggest boost and put in the biggest trouble this week and the give their top 12 teams overall heading into the final week of play before the playoffs are locked. Following that, they take a look at the crazy coaching carousel, starting with the situation on Penn State as they continue to look for a new head coach to replace James Franklin.

They break down some of the big stories from National Signing Day.
