    <desc lang="en">Master filmmaker Sidney Lumet (The Verdict, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) delivers "one of his greatest achievements" (Roger Ebert) with this riveting and compelling suspense thriller. Oscar®-winner* Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) is Andy, an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke, Training Day), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering clash that may obliterate their already precarious lives.</desc>

Jeffrey's vow of chastity is inspired by a fear of AIDS, a prospect which has started to terrify him so much that he decides he'd be better off never making love again. He is happy and relieved for a time, until he meets Steve, a handsome, charming dreamboat who also happens to be HIV-positive. Jeffrey wants nothing more than to be with Steve, but his anxiety over the disease and fear of commitment stand in the way.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Angel Maker: Serial Killer Queen</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the 19th century, England controlled the biggest Empire the world had ever seen. Scientific breakthroughs, huge scale engineering, and great leaps in medicine led Britain's reign of global power. And yet, behind the facade there was a darkness. An unimaginable world of evil - theft, rape, murder and more. This was the real world of Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes. But there was a lesser known killer on the loose who was far worse than any of the others, a woman who would succeed in becoming one of the world's most prolific serial killers. Her name was Amelia Dyer and she killed over 400 innocent babies.  A seemingly gentle old lady, Amelia would take in children under the guise of nurturing and caring for them when in reality she starved and strangled them to death. Explore inconceivable recesses of humanity in this shockingly true story of human darkness and depravity at the turn of the century.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Anna: Scream Queen Killer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The ultimate in actress exploitation, Scream Queen Killer takes you on a journey into the world of indie grindhouse film auditions with a mind bending twist. Anna is a young actress desperate to make it in the movies. She is invited to a series of filmed auditions, playing out various scenarios on camera. The problem is, the director is a perverted psychopath with only one thing on his mind. As Anna progresses through an ever more bizarre series of roles she slowly realizes that something is horribly wrong with this audition. Forced to strip and perform carnal acts in the name of the art, she eventually flips and takes matters into her own hands. A scenario many actresses may recognize in the industry, Scream Queen Killer is brutally realistic and superbly acted by Melanie Denholme (Lady of the Dark). How far is too far? And how far would you go to get the role?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The episode opens with contestant Geoff Rempel sharing his powerful backstory and the unique challenges of competing without a military or firearms background—proving that heart, not just experience, earns a place on this team. As the mission begins, the team links up with Pete from Red Cat Drones to run light recon and test critical communication between ground and aerial support. Red Cat brings the best of the best to the skies while the team takes to the ground on bikes, learning to operate under pressure with real-time air-to-ground coordination. But it’s not all strategy and tech—emotions run high as contestant Hayley Taylor opens up about her late father and the personal mission driving her to push harder every day. From aerial coverage to cover stories, it’s not just about who’s strongest... it’s about who’s ready when it counts.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The day kicks off with a one-of-a-kind “hatting ceremony” as Don Mann is crowned—then quite literally set on fire. But there’s no time to admire the flames; Ken Shamrock is waiting with another round of punishing Lion’s Den training. With Iron Man training just one day away, the pressure is at an all-time high. Contestant Landon reflects on his past Surviving Mann experience, paying tribute to the mentors who guided him—and now stepping into that role himself. The countdown to mission time begins as gear is packed, coordinates plotted, and details roll in via Red Cat Drones. With the ISR team deployed, the first phase of the mission is underway. Every contestant must be ready to deliver their cover for status in an instant—because in this game, hesitation can be the difference between success and failure.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ken Shamrock’s Iron Man competition comes to a head as two contestants battle it out for the number one spot. Every strike, every takedown matters—because only one can walk away crowned the victor. But there’s no time to celebrate. It’s mission day. After a quick live-fire break, the team receives critical intel from the ISR daylight crew. The risk spikes as night falls and the mission is suddenly altered, forcing the contestants to adapt on the fly. With Red Cat providing coordination from above, the squad is redeployed under new marching orders and even higher stakes. A partially compromised team makes survival uncertain, but when the moment of truth arrives, the team leader takes decisive action—leading a direct breach on the target. One bold decision shifts the course of the mission entirely, and its success now hangs by a thread.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With the mission complete, the contestants think the season is winding down—but HQ has other plans. Their once-fabricated cover story becomes reality, pulling them into a pulse-pounding new challenge designed to test strength, coordination, and mastery of weaponry. This hybrid competition pushes every skill to the limit, weeding out all but the most well-rounded tactical athletes. Along the way, the legendary Don Mann shares his own backstory, giving rare insight into the life and mindset of the man behind the mission. When the dust settles, only one competitor will rise above the rest—earning the title of the season’s most complete warrior.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau visits the amazing landscape of Croatia, which has some of the worlds' most amazing waterfalls and caves.  At the Plitvice Lakes National Park, Philippe explores the ever changing lakes systems due to naturally forming dams.  Philippe also discovers some large caves and sees how stalactites and stalagmites are formed.  Then it's onto the island of Brac, which is famous for their limestone quarries.  We visit a stone masonry school where students turn white limestone into beautiful works of art.</desc>
