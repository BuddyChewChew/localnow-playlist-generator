    <desc lang="en">Master filmmaker Sidney Lumet (The Verdict, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) delivers "one of his greatest achievements" (Roger Ebert) with this riveting and compelling suspense thriller. Oscar®-winner* Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) is Andy, an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke, Training Day), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering clash that may obliterate their already precarious lives.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This romantic comedy centers on the chaotic love life of Jeffrey, a gay man who swears off sex only to fall in love with his ideal man. Jeffrey's vow of chastity is inspired by a fear of AIDS, a prospect which has started to terrify him so much that he decides he'd be better off never making love again. He is happy and relieved for a time, until he meets Steve, a handsome, charming dreamboat who also happens to be HIV-positive. Jeffrey wants nothing more than to be with Steve, but his anxiety over the disease and fear of commitment stand in the way.</desc>

When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute – Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener. Dr. Angelo's goal is to benefit his human guinea pig and ultimately mankind itself, but evil lurks the guise of "the Shop," a shadowy group that seeks to use the technology to create an invincible war machine. When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for the control of Jobe's mind and the future of the world.</desc>

If you love the outdoors, trout fishing, and pure beauty, the Sierras have it all. We especially enjoy venturing up in the fall when the weather changes, the fall colors start popping, and the fishing is phenomenal. The Sierras offer endless options for camping, hiking, and fishing, and that’s exactly what we’re doing for the next couple of weeks. Join us as we explore some creek fishing around Park's Resort, lake fishing at South and Sabrina Lake, and then head into the backcountry for an epic day hike. Don’t miss out on this adventure through one of the most picturesque and diverse regions of California!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The stakes continue to climb as Green Light Sights rewards one top shooter with their very own custom weapon—proof that precision pays off. But there's no time to celebrate. Bear Arms ups the ante by issuing defense vests to every contestant, with one hard rule: once it’s on, it stays on. From grueling mission briefings to body armor plank challenges that push endurance to the brink, the weight—literally and mentally—never lets up. Still armored, the team reports to Ken Shamrock for another brutal dose of Lion’s Den physical punishment. Just when they think they’ve caught a break, Compliant Technologies’ infamous glove makes a shocking return to torment a fresh round of contestants. And as the day winds down, Don introduces the team to his personal “Flights” challenge—an unforgiving test no one is excited to take on. It all ends with a sobering CIA reminder: in the field, your backstory might just save your life—or end it.</desc>
