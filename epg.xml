    <desc lang="en">Surviving Mann returns with its most punishing season opener yet. In true Don Mann fashion, the bar is raised with a grueling 10-part physical readiness test—infused with a blast of hypothermia for good measure. Don himself calls it “the most brutal PT [he’s] ever witnessed,” and it’s clear the contestants are in for a world of hurt. To push them even further, MMA legend Ken Shamrock joins the fray, bringing his no-nonsense intensity to whip the group into fighting shape. Those who survive the trial by ice and exertion are rewarded with a chance to test-fire the lightest AR on the market—if they can still feel their trigger fingers.</desc>

Then it's off to Florida to join members of the Seminole tribe who show us different uses of plants as tools and food in the harsh terrain of the everglades.  We wrap things up in the Pacific Northwest looking at how the Suquamish tribe teaches today's youth the importance of salmon conservation.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">We look at different examples of cultural science.  Starting off in Hawaii, Philippe paddles out on a 6-man canoe during a lesson in early Hawaiian navigation.  Then it's off to Florida to join members of the Seminole tribe who show us different uses of plants as tools and food in the harsh terrain of the everglades.

    <desc lang="en">We look at different examples of cultural science.  Starting off in Hawaii, Philippe paddles out on a 6-man canoe during a lesson in early Hawaiian navigation.  Then it's off to Florida to join members of the Seminole tribe who show us different uses of plants as tools and food in the harsh terrain of the everglades.  We wrap things up in the Pacific Northwest looking at how the Suquamish tribe teaches today's youth the importance of salmon conservation.</desc>
