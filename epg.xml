    <title lang="en">Four of the Apocalypse 1975</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Four of the Apocalypse, director Lucio Fulci delivers a gritty and haunting Spaghetti Western. After a crooked sheriff banishes four misfits—a gambler, a prostitute, a drunk, and a simple-minded man—they journey across a lawless frontier searching for survival and redemption. But their path collides with a sadistic bandit, plunging them into violence, cruelty, and despair. Blending raw brutality with moments of tenderness, this bleak tale explores the struggle for humanity in a world gone savage.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Anna: Scream Queen Killer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The ultimate in actress exploitation, Scream Queen Killer takes you on a journey into the world of indie grindhouse film auditions with a mind bending twist. Anna is a young actress desperate to make it in the movies. She is invited to a series of filmed auditions, playing out various scenarios on camera. The problem is, the director is a perverted psychopath with only one thing on his mind. As Anna progresses through an ever more bizarre series of roles she slowly realizes that something is horribly wrong with this audition. Forced to strip and perform carnal acts in the name of the art, she eventually flips and takes matters into her own hands. A scenario many actresses may recognize in the industry, Scream Queen Killer is brutally realistic and superbly acted by Melanie Denholme (Lady of the Dark). How far is too far? And how far would you go to get the role?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this episode, Chef Jay Ducote brings along a very special fishing buddy, his dad, for our first-ever Catch &amp; Cook freshwater adventure! We’re heading to the legendary Toledo Bend, famous for its sac-a-lait (Cajun for crappie) and ranked among the top bass lakes in the U.S. It’s a bucket-list stop for anglers everywhere, but trust us, the story doesn’t end with the fish.

Steeped in Spanish, French, and Native American roots dating back to the Louisiana Purchase, this region serves up culture and flavor as rich as its fishing. We’ll be staying at Wildwood Resort, hitting the water with Captain Matt Loetscher of Living The Dream Guide Service, and capping off the day with spectacular lake views from their breezy lakeside bar.
Hook, line, and sinker — you don’t want to miss this one!
