    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>
