    <desc lang="en">Who is the bloody figure wielding a meat cleaver, seen racing through the alleys of British Columbia’s Chinatown? Whoever he is, he has terrified dozens of witnesses, who have never been the same afterwards. The brutal history of Cornwall Jail, Ottawa’s most notorious prison, lives on as ghostly apparitions of tortured inmates terrorize modern visitors. In its heyday it was home to vicious criminals, and sadistic guards. Hangings, whippings and torture were daily affairs and spirits from that era still linger on in the maze of cell blocks and corridors. Many male criminals were hanged at the Northwest Mounted Police outpost known as Fort Saskatchewan, but only one woman. Florence Lassandro was dubbed the Mob Princess, and her spirit is one of many seen on the grounds and in the preserved buildings of this historic site. Journey through several of the world's most haunted prisons and experience real portals to hell on earth.</desc>

But it’s not until after getting fired from his job, finding his girl getting railed by a tranny and almost getting arrested for drug trafficking, that Keefer decides (with the help of his best friend Meegosh) to start an underground food eating competition. After the health crazed Mayor Fingstal and his cronies Officers Slivjack and Biggsley catch wind of it, all hell breaks loose. Then it all comes down to one final food battle from hell, THE NACHO MOUNTAIN!  Set to a killer Stoner Rock soundtrack with loads of babes and crazy characters in the vein of Porky's and Meatballs, Nacho Mountain is sure to please those who have gotten beaten down, only to eat their way to the top!</desc>

With a passion for revitalizing the trades, Michael stresses the importance of training programs and investing in people as he maps out his goal of scaling to a $100M company—and even explores franchising with Kevin. Next, teacher-turned-inventor Sean Worthington introduces Raida Tech, where a bathtub question—“What is money?”—led to a new form of data-supremacy currency and safer, uncensored AI. Sean looks to the A-Team for marketing, sales, and customer acquisition support. Then, Dale Krueger of Tangible Assets LLC explains how his coin-collecting hobby evolved into an investment platform blending art and assets, now ready to scale beyond word-of-mouth investors.

    <desc lang="en">Oakmont isn’t just one of the most historic courses in golf — it’s home to one of the most exclusive clubhouses in American sports. 

Ahead of the 125th U.S. Open Championship, we step inside the walls of Oakmont Country Club — a place steeped in U.S. Open history, whispered legends, and decades of golf’s most iconic moments. From the original locker room that held Hogan’s shoes to the trophies that shaped golf’s golden era, this is a rare look at the soul of championship golf.
