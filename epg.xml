But when he meets his intended victim—and falls for the rancher’s restless wife (Jenny Agutter)—the deal turns deadly. Torn between passion, loyalty, and survival, the three are swept into a violent showdown where betrayal and desire collide. With raw emotion, striking landscapes, and gritty shootouts, this revisionist Western blurs the line between love and vengeance.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Muckman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mickey O'Hara is a television producer on the skids whose career was virtually destroyed when his attempt to discover the legendary backwoods demon Muckman was exposed as a pathetic fraud on live television. Using his in with sexy trash TV personality Asia Buchanan (Anju McIntyre) as leverage he persuades small time cable mogul Otto Van Sant to give him one last chance to redeem himself. Claiming a secret source in the backwoods of Pennsylvania, Mickey and Asia, along with technical crew Jerome “Curly” Baker, Drew Simmons, production manager Pauline Stark and able assistant Billie Mulligan set off to find and exploit the Muckie Mystery. They’re met in the middle of nowhere by Cletus Hobbs, Mickey’s secret source, who leads them to the cabin which will be their home base for the production. After a disastrous first night Cletus meets them in the morning accompanied by his cretinous cousins Horace and Elmer, who take the gang to their “Muckman Mooseum” on the edge of a nearby swamp. Various Muckman artifacts, including a Muckman skull under glass, are on display. More convincing is the unearthly howl the crew hears outside the museum. Giving chase, the gang sees a hirsute figure fleeing through the woods (leaving behind the unbearable stench characteristic of Muckman), capturing a glimpse of the creature on tape. That night they get an even better look at the monster when it attacks their cabin, and the following evening when the crew attempts to document the capture of the creature in a trap set by Cletus and his boys all hell breaks loose. The creature appears big as life. Chaos ensues, there is blood and dismemberment, but all is not as it seems. Cletus and his gang have their own agenda, as do Mickey and Asia, and even Billie knows more than she lets on.

    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">Surviving Mann returns with its most punishing season opener yet. In true Don Mann fashion, the bar is raised with a grueling 10-part physical readiness test—infused with a blast of hypothermia for good measure. Don himself calls it “the most brutal PT [he’s] ever witnessed,” and it’s clear the contestants are in for a world of hurt. To push them even further, MMA legend Ken Shamrock joins the fray, bringing his no-nonsense intensity to whip the group into fighting shape. Those who survive the trial by ice and exertion are rewarded with a chance to test-fire the lightest AR on the market—if they can still feel their trigger fingers.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">For the first time in Surviving Mann history, the contestants undergo intense combat training led by none other than Ken Shamrock—"the most dangerous man in the world." His relentless situation drills push this elite group beyond their limits, sharpening their instincts and forging next-level tactical readiness. As a new mission begins to take shape, the pressure mounts—and the team learns that the strongest among them will earn a game-changing reward. But in a world where every edge matters, not everyone is built to keep up. Fatigue sets in, tensions rise, and the difference between teammate and competitor begins to blur. With Shamrock watching closely, only the most disciplined will rise to meet the challenge—and prove they’re worthy of what lies ahead.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Montgomery Gentry: First we go to Chesapeake, Virginia to meet up with country duo Montgomery Gentry before they go on stage. Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry give host, Drew Waters a tour of their two tricked out luxury buses. Eddie Montgomery first shows us around his bus, which is themed out to be a portable party on wheels. From Mardi Gras d�cor to a booming sound system, Eddie's bus was designed to entertain. With custom flooring, fully stocked bar and kitchen, a wine refrigerator, and a master suite with a walk in shower, it's no wonder that Eddie prefers to spend most of his time in his bus! Eddie even shares one of his favorite snacks with Drew when they both eat pickled eggs. Troy Gentry then gives Drew a tour of his bus, which has been decked out to feel like a bat cave where Troy and his team can get business done as well as relax. Troy shows off his redesigned kitchen where he and his wife can cook some down home country meals no matter where they are. His bus also features rustic dark wood floors and master suite with a walk in shower that features bench seating. Jeff Dunham: Then we're off to Billings, Montana where Drew meets up with ventriloquist comedian, Jeff Dunham before he performs in front of a sold out crowd. Jeff and his wife Audrey give Drew the tour of their home away from home. As the highest paid ventriloquist in the world, Jeff has been able to customize his luxury tour bus to meet his every need. Jeff's bus features a modern style that runs throughout a living room, kitchen, dining area, bunks, dog kennel, work out space and writing room, but the main attraction on this top of the line tour bus is a fully customized puppet work shop where Jeff can create, maintain and repair all of his co-stars. Jeff surprises Drew with a guest appearance from his hilarious puppet, Walter.Rodney Atkins: Last we head to Nashville, Tennessee where country sensation Rodney Atkins gives us a tour of his luxury liner. Rodney's tour bus features a French country themed living room, extra large kitchen with enough room to clean a deer and a master suite where he can kick off his boots and get some shut-eye. Rodney also introduces us to two things he never leaves home with out. The first is his best friend, a parrot named Misty that makes some unusual noises. Then Rodney lets us check out his pride a joy, a motorcycle that he uses to drive around the cities he visits while on tour.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First last we head Temecula, California, to meet up with X-Games champion and dirt bike rider, Brian Deegan. Brian gives Drew a tour of not just one, but three unique motor homes. The first is an over the top coach with a fireplace that he and his family use at the races and when on vacation. Then, Brian shows us his very first motor home that he now uses when he's riding with the guys. He's not afraid to let this RV get a little dirty. The highlight of this home away from home is a back garage where he stores and transports his mule. And last, Brian shows us the latest addition to his fleet, a hauler attached to a semi that he uses at all his races. This enormous motor home features a mechanics garage, lockers for his entire race team and an office where they can do business. The highlight of his hauler is course the garage used to store his gold medal winning dirt bikes. Drew then joins Brian for a ride on his custom-built dirt bike track right in his own backyard! Then we head to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where we catch up with one of country music's hottest young duos, Florida Georgia Line. Tyler and Brian give us a tour of their brand new 52-foot tour bus. Our first stop in this grand coach is a lounge designed to keep the party going after the show, complete with entertainment center, surround sound and automatic windows, Tyler and Brian have really decked out this space to the nines. Then the guys take us to the back of the bus where check out a their custom sleeping quarters and their favorite space on the whole bus, a back lounge which they have appropriately named "The Bat Cave." Last we arrive in Simpsonville, South Carolina, where Drew meets up with actress and country star, Jana Kramer before her show. Jana gives Drew a tour of her home on wheels that she shares with the ten guys that make up her band and crew. Jana explains to Drew that to ride on her bus, you have to be able to take a joke! That's why throughout the tour, Jana plays several practical jokes on Drew, hazing him into the club. Janna's bus features a living space that her puppy, Junior calls home, as well as a guest bathroom and bunks for all the guys. As the queen of this country caravan, Jana's bus also features a private master suite that she can call her own.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Our tour of these spectacular celebrity motor homes starts as we head to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina to check out NASCAR driver, Johanna Long's rolling retreat that's taken the luxury super highway all the way to the checkered flag. Johanna starts off by showing Drew her upscale modern living room designed specifically to her specks. Complete with sectional couch, hidden big screen TV and a fully equipped kitchen, this motor home has redefined on the word luxury. From the living space we head towards the back of the bus and Johanna's personal space, where we see a feature we've never seen before, a master suite with a motorized bed that reclines. Then the tour continues as Johanna and Drew check out the hauler she uses to transport and maintain her race cars. Then we're off to Arrington, Tennessee, to meet up with Kix Brooks at his very own winery where he shows around his country coach that has been fully customized to his southern style. With high-end rich mahogany accents throughout and marble floors, this coach is sure to impress! Last we head to Simpsonville, South Carolina, where country favorite Justin Moore shows us how he lives life on the road in his highly customized tour bus that merges modern decor with that down home country feel. Justin's tour bus boasts several unique features that make this vehicle a fan favorite. In the main living space are Justin's favorite captain's chairs, which have been upholstered with some good ol' fashioned rawhide. Then Justin shows off the snakeskin covered cabinets and beer tap that make his kitchen one of the best yet. The tour continues into Justin's own master bedroom where he has installed two flat screen TV's so that he never misses a football game.</desc>
