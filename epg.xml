    <desc lang="en">Master filmmaker Sidney Lumet (The Verdict, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) delivers "one of his greatest achievements" (Roger Ebert) with this riveting and compelling suspense thriller. Oscar®-winner* Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) is Andy, an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke, Training Day), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering clash that may obliterate their already precarious lives.</desc>

Jeffrey's vow of chastity is inspired by a fear of AIDS, a prospect which has started to terrify him so much that he decides he'd be better off never making love again. He is happy and relieved for a time, until he meets Steve, a handsome, charming dreamboat who also happens to be HIV-positive. Jeffrey wants nothing more than to be with Steve, but his anxiety over the disease and fear of commitment stand in the way.</desc>

When his experiments on animals fail, he finds the ideal substitute – Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a slow-witted gardener.

When the experiments change the simple Jobe into a superhuman being, the stage is set for a Jekyll-and-Hyde struggle for the control of Jobe's mind and the future of the world.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Spook Town 1944</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dty Gulch Trading Post owner Kurt Fabian advances money on mortgages to the local settlers to finance an irrigation program. Three Texas Rangers, Tex Wyatt, Jim Steele and Panhandle Perkins transport the money in a strong box which they place in the Wells Fargo safe as agent Sam Benson assures them that he is the only one who knows the safe combination. Fabian conspires with Bill Gunner, Breed Crocker and Trigger Booth to steal the money and they fail, but Fabian gets it on his own. Benson is arrested, and a committee of citizens, led by Oscar Perrin accuse Captain Wyatt and the Rangers of carelessness and request the resignation of the Captain if the money is not recovered.

    <desc lang="en">Luke Cranney has been guiding sheep in Idaho for 11 years, and packing in Alaska for 2. Everything lined up, and he got the chance to go on a hunt of his own. However, unlike many sheep hunts they had no scouting or plan in place. This was a true adventure hunt filled with bad weather, beautiful animals, and uncanny good luck. Follow Luke, Austin and Brady on an experience they will never forget.

    <desc lang="en">We were very fortunate to play a roll in capturing Kyle Ekker's hunt on film. Kyle Ekker grew up in Green River Utah where he developed his love of hunting, chasing mulies on the Book Cliffs. He has worked for the Emery County Sheriff's Office for 30 years where he is currently employed as a captain. He has been a member of the Utah FNAWS for the last 10 years and through this he is able to share his passion for the outdoors &amp; wild sheep.  In December of 2015 he drew the highly coveted Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sportsman's permit. This tag gave him the opportunity to hunt sheep from the beginning of September to December 31st on almost any open units in the state.  He hunted every opportunity that he had he could in pursuit of his dream ram.  On November 30th things came together for him and he was able to harvest a very magnificent ram. With an unofficial green score of 194" this ram will be the largest public land ram ever killed in the state of Utah.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Nautilus: Pakistani Hash On The High Seas</title>
    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Shattered Shield: Nabbing Dirty Cops</title>
    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday.

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

To do this, delaMontaigne befriends Biagio DiGiacomo in the restaurant he owns and becomes one of the regulars who make deals and plot various ways to make a dishonest dollar. His efforts finally pay off but not before he's entangled in illegal betting, drug sales and extortion simply by playing his undercover role so well and being in the right place at the right time.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Shattered Shield: Nabbing Dirty Cops</title>
    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Shattered Shield: Nabbing Dirty Cops</title>
    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Nautilus: Pakistani Hash On The High Seas</title>
    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Shattered Shield: Nabbing Dirty Cops</title>
    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation Nautilus: Pakistani Hash On The High Seas</title>
    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

To do this, delaMontaigne befriends Biagio DiGiacomo in the restaurant he owns and becomes one of the regulars who make deals and plot various ways to make a dishonest dollar. His efforts finally pay off but not before he's entangled in illegal betting, drug sales and extortion simply by playing his undercover role so well and being in the right place at the right time.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">US Customs agent Paul DeCotiis is part of an international undercover plan to intercept 70 tons of Pakistani hashish in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Customs uses a seized boat to meet the traffickers near Midway Island. High seas prevent most of the hash being transferred to the undercover boat, but Customs follows the drugs to the traffickers. DeCotiis is the point man throughout the operation between the Customs undercover team and a group of Canadian hippies hoping for a big payday. DeCotiis finally delivers the hash to the traffickers, resulting in several life sentences.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">FBI agent Juan Jackson goes undercover to build a case against corrupt New Orleans police officers, in the most corrupt city in America. Jackson learns that cops are ripping off street dealers, stealing their drugs and profiting from the sale of narcotics. They're using intimidation, violence, and ultimately, murder to silence witnesses who might consider testifying against them. Jackson befriends the corrupt cops to record their conversations and he becomes a target when they order a hit on him. In the end, 23 officers are indicted on various charges and the case forever changes the New Orleans police department.</desc>
