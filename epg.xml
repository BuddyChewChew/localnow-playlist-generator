Logan Chamberlain put together a massive weekend, capturing both Pro Singles and Pro Doubles alongside Gavin Cano, and the crew breaks down what made his performance so dominant. Jake, Meesh, and Cory recap everything from Signature #2 in Las Vegas, including standout runs across the divisions.

We also hit the rest of the podiums from the weekend, including wins from Kamryn Belvin, Jay Dotson, Gabriel Clauson, and more across Women’s, Seniors, and Juniors competition. To wrap things up, we bring some Vegas energy with the Cornhole Olympics Medal Ceremony, handing out gold medals for the most entertaining moments of the event: Best facial expressions Best drip Who looked like they were having the most fun in Vegas Best crowd energy The ultimate “How Did That Not Go In?” shot Plus, we close the show with another round of Hole-y Hot Takes.
