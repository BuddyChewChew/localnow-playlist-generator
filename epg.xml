    <desc lang="en">Based on Arkady Fiedler's bestseller, Squadron 303 relates the true story of the Polish pilots who were heroes in the Battle of Britain. Jan Zumbach is recovering from a plane crash in a sanatorium when WWII breaks out. The Nazi onslaught forces him to escape from occupied Poland. A similar fate awaits the heroic flight instructor, Witold Urbanowicz. Both make their way to Great Britain and carry on the fight against the Nazi Luftwaffe. Quickly, their heroism and skill catch the attention of commanders, and an elite, Polish fighter squadron is created: Squadron 303. At first they are underestimated and mocked, but thanks to the outstanding patriotism and bravery of its members, the squadron quickly wins respect.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Manchester City struck twice late at Anfield to snatch a dramatic 2-1 Premier League win over Liverpool. Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free kick put the Reds ahead, but Bernardo Silva and an Erling Haaland penalty turned it around in the closing minutes, with late chaos capped by a red card for Szoboszlai.

We also react to Arsenal's win over Sunderland and Manchester United's incredible run as their streak rolls on. Our panel breaks down the key moments, tactical twists, and what it all means for the Premier League title race.</desc>
