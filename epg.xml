In true Don Mann fashion, the bar is raised with a grueling 10-part physical readiness test—infused with a blast of hypothermia for good measure. Don himself calls it “the most brutal PT [he’s] ever witnessed,” and it’s clear the contestants are in for a world of hurt. To push them even further, MMA legend Ken Shamrock joins the fray, bringing his no-nonsense intensity to whip the group into fighting shape. Those who survive the trial by ice and exertion are rewarded with a chance to test-fire the lightest AR on the market—if they can still feel their trigger fingers.</desc>

His relentless situation drills push this elite group beyond their limits, sharpening their instincts and forging next-level tactical readiness. As a new mission begins to take shape, the pressure mounts—and the team learns that the strongest among them will earn a game-changing reward. But in a world where every edge matters, not everyone is built to keep up. Fatigue sets in, tensions rise, and the difference between teammate and competitor begins to blur. With Shamrock watching closely, only the most disciplined will rise to meet the challenge—and prove they’re worthy of what lies ahead.</desc>

    <desc lang="en"> Matt is out for revenge. Last year Dale beat him badly at the Annual Vintage bike race in Barber, Alabama. But this year there is a whole new tale to tell. With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt&amp;#39;s prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don&amp;#39;t tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>

    <desc lang="en"> Built in the mid-60’s by eccentric engineer “Wild Bill” Gelbke, the Road Dog was, and still is, the largest motorcycle ever built. It utilized aircraft tubing, Corvette disc brakes, and a Chevy truck differential to keep it stable. The one-off creation disappeared when Gelbke did in 1978. Outflanked once when the bike was spotted and sold to a private collector in 1995, Dale has vowed to locate the machine and make Wheels Through Time its final resting place.</desc>
