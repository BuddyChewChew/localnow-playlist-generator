    <desc lang="en">For the first time in Surviving Mann history, the contestants undergo intense combat training led by none other than Ken Shamrock—"the most dangerous man in the world." His relentless situation drills push this elite group beyond their limits, sharpening their instincts and forging next-level tactical readiness. As a new mission begins to take shape, the pressure mounts—and the team learns that the strongest among them will earn a game-changing reward. But in a world where every edge matters, not everyone is built to keep up. Fatigue sets in, tensions rise, and the difference between teammate and competitor begins to blur. With Shamrock watching closely, only the most disciplined will rise to meet the challenge—and prove they’re worthy of what lies ahead.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Good morning, everyone! Over the past few weeks, we've been soaking up the sun at Parer's Resort, nestled above Bishop, California, in the stunning Eastern Sierras. Our adventure kicked off with some thrilling pocket creek fishing. We then made our way to South Lake, where we spent a fantastic afternoon with Jared on the pontoon boat. Today, we're kicking off our adventure in the breathtaking surroundings of Lake Sabrina with Seth and Jared. We're venturing into the backcountry for a scenic hike to Long Lake—a first for us in this slice of paradise. Get ready for an unforgettable journey, as we're stoked on trout. Let's go fishing</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>
