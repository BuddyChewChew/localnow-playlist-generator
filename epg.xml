    <title lang="en">Hybrid World: The Plan to Modify and Control the Human Race</title>
    <desc lang="en">Behind closed doors scientists and corporations have breached genetic codes that separate the individuality of all animal and plant species on earth. Laboratories around the world are honing their skills while our humanity and dignity as a species is on the operating table like a universal Frankenstein, subject to a wholesale psychic and physiological re-design under the guise of progress.  The proponents claim the field of "Transhumanism" will change the world by eliminating sickness and famine while at the same time, governments and military groups around the globe are having clandestine meetings to discuss super soldiers, super intelligence, and even super animals to maintain military dominance and control over the populations of the world. Even more horrifying they must create committees to implement plans to defend their nations against future terrorism performed by transhumans (modified human beings) with the universal understanding that no nation can afford NOT to engage in this apocalyptic future of genetically altered life. We are at war for the mind of a generation and the soul of the human race. Billions of dollars are at stake with corporations and powerful individuals looking toward a post human future world. If we care about our humanity, then the time is NOW to stand up and understand where science and technology are taking us and to do something about it. Our foods are already being genetically altered with devastating side effects which are now coming to light. Will we allow experiments with genetic engineering to excel to a horrifying level where they create an unthinkable race of non-human entities? What level of horrifying abominations have already been committed?</desc>

Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau travels to Curacao and dives along the coral reefs to capture lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying the sea life in these waters.  We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau travels to Curacao and dives along the coral reefs to capture lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying the sea life in these waters.  We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau visits geological wonders that have been shaped over time by water and ice.  We go to the Grand Canyon, which is a treasure trove of earth's history.  Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau travels to Curacao and dives along the coral reefs to capture lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying the sea life in these waters.  We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>
