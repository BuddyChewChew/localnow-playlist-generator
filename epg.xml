    <desc lang="en">In Jesse and Lester, Gianni Garko and Aldo Sambrell star in a Spaghetti Western with a comedic twist. When rough-and-tumble gunman Jesse teams up with mild-mannered preacher Lester, the unlikely duo sets out to claim an inheritance that could change their lives. But standing in their way are outlaws, double-crosses, and plenty of misadventures on the trail. Blending sharp humor, action, and classic Western style, this buddy adventure proves that opposites can make the wildest partners.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.

For our first entry, we turned to Austin, Texas’ own Scott Ballew. Our good buddy, Scott, is a filmmaker and songwriter who owns a Bohemian bungalow in the heart of Austin’s first suburb. It’s a home now that serves as a creative incubator, gathering place, hideaway, recording studio -- and maybe, as a personal shrine of a man curated by the man himself.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Meet Luke DiTella—once a pro surfer, now the founder of Frank August whiskey, and an all-around Renaissance man. Whether it's barrels at a Jersey beach break or barrels of aged whiskey, Luke knows how to turn life into an art form. In this episode of Huckberry Homes, we take a deep dive into Luke’s world at his coastal haven in Monmouth Beach, New Jersey. It’s a place where the salty sea air meets the rich aroma of aged whiskey—a home that’s as rugged yet refined as the man himself. Luke opens his doors to share tales of surfing glory, entrepreneurial grit, and the beautiful chaos of fatherhood (spoiler: they don't care about your design aesthetic).</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For our second episode of Huckberry Homes, we set our sights on the Oregon coast and flew out to see our friends ‪@ben_moon‬ and Sophie Kuller. Tired of fixing up other people's houses, Ben decided to spend the last few years crafting his own house from the ground up, while getting help from his friends, Dad, and Sophie along the way. This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.

We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land.</desc>

When he’s not rucking to and from the GORUCK HQ, you can find him and his friends putting on grueling garage workouts that are the talk of the neighborhood. 

Huckberry and GORUCK go way back, we’ve shared plenty of good times, GORUCK Challenges, and (more than) a few beers along the way. Their military-grade lineup is designed to be taken to hell and back in the field. So whether you’re traveling the world or “embracing the suck” with a 30 LB plate in your rucksack, you can be sure your gear’s up to the challenge."</desc>
