    <desc lang="en">Who is the bloody figure wielding a meat cleaver, seen racing through the alleys of British Columbia’s Chinatown? Whoever he is, he has terrified dozens of witnesses, who have never been the same afterwards. The brutal history of Cornwall Jail, Ottawa’s most notorious prison, lives on as ghostly apparitions of tortured inmates terrorize modern visitors. In its heyday it was home to vicious criminals, and sadistic guards. Hangings, whippings and torture were daily affairs and spirits from that era still linger on in the maze of cell blocks and corridors. Many male criminals were hanged at the Northwest Mounted Police outpost known as Fort Saskatchewan, but only one woman. Florence Lassandro was dubbed the Mob Princess, and her spirit is one of many seen on the grounds and in the preserved buildings of this historic site. Journey through several of the world's most haunted prisons and experience real portals to hell on earth.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">ATF agent Jay Dobyns infiltrates the notorious Hell's Angels motorcycle club in the midst of a deadly biker war over drug profits and territory. Dobyns must first pass a series of tests to determine if he's worthy of wearing Angels' colors and running with the pack. To collect evidence against the gang, the ATF agent must outsmart the club at its own game. But in doing so, Dobyns places a target on his back and puts his family in harm's way.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">ATF agent Jay Dobyns infiltrates the notorious Hell's Angels motorcycle club in the midst of a deadly biker war over drug profits and territory. Dobyns must first pass a series of tests to determine if he's worthy of wearing Angels' colors and running with the pack. To collect evidence against the gang, the ATF agent must outsmart the club at its own game. But in doing so, Dobyns places a target on his back and puts his family in harm's way.</desc>
