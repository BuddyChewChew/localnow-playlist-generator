    <desc lang="en">Wow, holy Eastern Sierra! It's been a full month of trout shows, and we've been trying to cover as much as possible with trout fishing in the creeks above Bishop. We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley. I promise you, this is an ending to a show you won't want to miss. Ryan got a big one; Ryan got a big one!</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stoked on Fishing | Back Country Trout Fishing</title>
    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>

It utilized aircraft tubing, Corvette disc brakes, and a Chevy truck differential to keep it stable. The one-off creation disappeared when Gelbke did in 1978. Outflanked once when the bike was spotted and sold to a private collector in 1995, Dale has vowed to locate the machine and make Wheels Through Time its final resting place.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau visits geological wonders that have been shaped over time by water and ice.  We go to the Grand Canyon, which is a treasure trove of earth's history.  Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau visits geological wonders that have been shaped over time by water and ice.  We go to the Grand Canyon, which is a treasure trove of earth's history.  Then Philippe visits an ancient cave on the island of Curacao; a cave that was excavated by sea water thousands of years ago.  We travel to Lake Michigan and discover how glaciers created the Great Lakes. Then we look into the future, and see if our planet will ever experience another ice age.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau travels to Curacao and dives along the coral reefs to capture lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying the sea life in these waters.  We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marine Restoration</title>
    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau travels to Curacao and dives along the coral reefs to capture lionfish, an invasive species that's destroying the sea life in these waters.  We visit the Chesapeake Bay to see what's being done to restore the oyster population. Then Philippe goes to Alaska and sees some areas that are still suffering from the Exxon-Valdez oil spill, which occurred over 25 years ago.  Then we explore how the Mississippi River can be used to rebuild the disappearing wetlands in Louisiana.</desc>
