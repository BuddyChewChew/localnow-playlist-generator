    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>

We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley.
