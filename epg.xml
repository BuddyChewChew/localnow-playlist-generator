    <desc lang="en">Was it time for James Franklin to go at Penn State? On this episode of Others Receiving Votes, Sports Illustrated's Pat Forde and Bryan Fischer are joined by former longtime College Gameday Reporter Gene Wojciechowski to break down the firing of Penn State Head Coach James Franklin after the teams loss to Northwestern, their third straight. They also breakdown whether Penn State is in position to be a championship contender in the Big Ten and for the College Football National Championship before giving their thoughts on who Penn State should turn to next, bringing up Curt Cignetti of Indiana and the tough choice he could have this offseason. After that, they give out their Midseason Awards for Heisman, Flop, Surprise, Coach and Team of the half season while also talking about some of the dumbest ideas that were brought up by the masses during the first half of the college football season. They finish things off with a view at some of the big games this weekend, giving their picks and some background on each matchup including a few games that could have College Football Playoff implications in USC vs. Notre Dame, BYU vs. Utah and Alabama vs. Tennessee.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The day kicks off with “The 1000-Yard Shot,” and the All-Stars are put to the test bright and early. Who will “make impact” and who will fall flat? Following the competition, Don receives a call from the CIA: the mission is officially greenlit, and it’s time for the All-Stars to kick things into high gear. This moment marks a pivotal shift in their training, with lives now hanging in the balance. After a crash course in the classroom, the All-Stars head to the field for what they think is a land navigation exercise… but things quickly spiral when a group of aggressive hostiles ambushes and captures the competitors for an intense hostage training scenario. Will any of them make it out—and live to tell the tale?</desc>

First he lands at Lulu's, a "high class dive" in Gulf Shores run by Jimmy Buffet's sister Lucy, for a Fried Green Tomato Pimento Cheese Burger. Next, Sabin hops on a golf cart and heads straight for Lucy Bell's on South Carolina's Daufuskie Island, where he tries their famous deviled blue crab and show-stopping Southern fried chicken. From there, Sabin goes San Diego's Barrio Dogg, famous for its Chile Con Carne Dog with a three-meat punch and its five-alarm Bombero Dog topped with seven salsas. His last stop is Sugar 'n Spice on Balboa Island, Calif., where the frozen banana has been king since 1945.

In Key West, he finds Salute on the Beach, a beachfront restaurant serving fresh-daily Yellowtail Snapper Alfredo and a light grouper cake with a few surprises. Then at California's Del Mar State Beach, he tries a West Coast twist on clam chowder with crunchy chicharones at Tackle Box.
