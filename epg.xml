Jan Zumbach is recovering from a plane crash in a sanatorium when WWII breaks out. The Nazi onslaught forces him to escape from occupied Poland. A similar fate awaits the heroic flight instructor, Witold Urbanowicz. Both make their way to Great Britain and carry on the fight against the Nazi Luftwaffe. Quickly, their heroism and skill catch the attention of commanders, and an elite, Polish fighter squadron is created: Squadron 303. At first they are underestimated and mocked, but thanks to the outstanding patriotism and bravery of its members, the squadron quickly wins respect.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Growing up in Southern California, there’s a special spot my dad would always take us: the Eastern Sierras. If you love the outdoors, trout fishing, and pure beauty, the Sierras have it all. We especially enjoy venturing up in the fall when the weather changes, the fall colors start popping, and the fishing is phenomenal. The Sierras offer endless options for camping, hiking, and fishing, and that’s exactly what we’re doing for the next couple of weeks. Join us as we explore some creek fishing around Park's Resort, lake fishing at South and Sabrina Lake, and then head into the backcountry for an epic day hike. Don’t miss out on this adventure through one of the most picturesque and diverse regions of California!</desc>

We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley. I promise you, this is an ending to a show you won't want to miss. Ryan got a big one; Ryan got a big one!</desc>
