Host of Angry Planet George Kourounis travels with a variety of experts to bring down huge avalanches in the Rocky Mountains. Ski Patrollers throw hand charges to clear the slopes, the British Columbia Department of Highways uses helicopter bombing and mountaintop mortars to keep the roads safe, and the Canadian Armed Forces fire 105mm howitzers at the mountains to bring down the dangerous snow. Still, there are accidents and fatalities in the mountains. We meet Francois Desroisers, an avalanche burial victim who tells a terrible and tragic tale of a mountain disaster.</desc>
