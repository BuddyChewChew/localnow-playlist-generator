    <title lang="en">Winter Wonderland</title>
    <desc lang="en">We head to a winter wonderland in Banff, Alberta, Canada.  Philippe joins the avalanche safety team at Ski Lake Louise as they show a few different ways of avalanche control including dynamite blasts on the mountain.  We then head to the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise for a snowshoeing expedition.  And finally we look at the dynamics of ice while climbing a frozen waterfall.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">We look at different examples of cultural science.  Starting off in Hawaii, Philippe paddles out on a 6-man canoe during a lesson in early Hawaiian navigation.  Then it's off to Florida to join members of the Seminole tribe who show us different uses of plants as tools and food in the harsh terrain of the everglades.  We wrap things up in the Pacific Northwest looking at how the Suquamish tribe teaches today's youth the importance of salmon conservation.</desc>
