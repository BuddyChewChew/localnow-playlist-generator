The journey kicks off at the world-famous Smoky Mountain Knife Works, the largest knife store on the planet, where Tim explores the artistry and precision behind the blades of We Knife. There, he reconnects with shooting legend Kyle Lamb, who shares his thoughts on the craftsmanship that keeps professionals equipped for anything. The action continues at Buds Gun Shop, where Tim joins Kyle once again to complete two of Lamb’s signature courses—the intense “Chaos Drill” and the dynamic “Triple Threat.” Together, they test speed, accuracy, and the mental discipline needed to master the range. But the day wouldn’t be complete without a little backwoods ingenuity.

    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ken Shamrock’s Iron Man competition comes to a head as two contestants battle it out for the number one spot. Every strike, every takedown matters—because only one can walk away crowned the victor. But there’s no time to celebrate. It’s mission day. After a quick live-fire break, the team receives critical intel from the ISR daylight crew. The risk spikes as night falls and the mission is suddenly altered, forcing the contestants to adapt on the fly. With Red Cat providing coordination from above, the squad is redeployed under new marching orders and even higher stakes. A partially compromised team makes survival uncertain, but when the moment of truth arrives, the team leader takes decisive action—leading a direct breach on the target. One bold decision shifts the course of the mission entirely, and its success now hangs by a thread.</desc>
