    <title lang="en">Hybrid World: The Plan to Modify and Control the Human Race</title>
    <desc lang="en">Behind closed doors scientists and corporations have breached genetic codes that separate the individuality of all animal and plant species on earth. Laboratories around the world are honing their skills while our humanity and dignity as a species is on the operating table like a universal Frankenstein, subject to a wholesale psychic and physiological re-design under the guise of progress.  The proponents claim the field of "Transhumanism" will change the world by eliminating sickness and famine while at the same time, governments and military groups around the globe are having clandestine meetings to discuss super soldiers, super intelligence, and even super animals to maintain military dominance and control over the populations of the world. Even more horrifying they must create committees to implement plans to defend their nations against future terrorism performed by transhumans (modified human beings) with the universal understanding that no nation can afford NOT to engage in this apocalyptic future of genetically altered life. We are at war for the mind of a generation and the soul of the human race. Billions of dollars are at stake with corporations and powerful individuals looking toward a post human future world. If we care about our humanity, then the time is NOW to stand up and understand where science and technology are taking us and to do something about it. Our foods are already being genetically altered with devastating side effects which are now coming to light. Will we allow experiments with genetic engineering to excel to a horrifying level where they create an unthinkable race of non-human entities?

    <desc lang="en">Back by unpopular demand, the infamous “Blah Line” returns—and it’s more brutal than ever. The contestants kick off the day with a hellish PT session that leaves bodies broken and spirits tested. Things only get rougher from there with a punishing stealth crawl over jagged rocks, grinding them down before they face Ken Shamrock’s infamous Lion’s Den training—a relentless gauntlet of pain, grit, and raw endurance. As Don Mann continues to forge a battle-ready team, the squad is thrown into breaching drills designed for high-stakes mission execution. It’s chaos, it’s calculated, and it separates the contenders from the pretenders. In the heat of the action, two standouts emerge from the ranks—earning the coveted role of designated breachers.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The day begins with a powerful dose of perspective as contestants hear real-life breaching stories from American heroes—reminders of the stakes they’re preparing for. The team is then introduced to a concealed firearm headrest safe designed for rapid-response vehicle defense. Next, it’s straight into the action with a preliminary course of fire using GreenLight sights, where top performers are pushed even further with a bonus round to test speed, accuracy, and composure under pressure. The intensity ramps up during a sentry scenario featuring SABRE CO₂ non-lethal cartridges, putting their stealth and judgment to the test. But just as the dust begins to settle, a new CIA briefing drops—and it’s the most dire yet. With mission reality closing in fast, the contestants close the day with a crash course in S.E.R.E. (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) training, rounding out their classroom combat readiness with hard-earned grit.</desc>
