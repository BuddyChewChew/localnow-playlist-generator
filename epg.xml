    <desc lang="en">After nearly losing her weapon while catching a dangerous criminal, Rita is taken off active duty to train at a facility in hand to hand combat for female police officers to avoid another dangerous situation. While there, she meets an old friend in the form of Robin Curry, a police officer with the Internal Affairs division of Palm Beach and the two catch up on old times. Robin seemed a little worried about something and tries to tell Rita during dinner but chooses not to. An hour or so later, Robin tries to call Rita up saying that she has to meet with her and so along with Chris, they go on the prowl to find her but are too late when Robin is found in a motel in her lingerie, cuffed and strangled to death. Things get personal for Rita at this point but her problems are just beginning when two officers from Special Investigations start asking sensitive questions about Rita's relationship with Robin, even suggesting that the two may have been lovers. Rita is shocked, appalled and extremely angry at the accusation and even more enraged when they suggest that Robin may have been crooked after $600,000 in evidence money turns up missing. Left high and dry and with no one else to turn to but Chris, Rita goes on a personal mission through the dark underworld of S&amp;M in an attempt to fight for her rights as a cop and save the reputation of her deceased colleague who may have been murdered because Robin knew the truth behind who really stole the money...and who tried to set her and Rita up.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Luke Cranney has been guiding sheep in Idaho for 11 years, and packing in Alaska for 2. Everything lined up, and he got the chance to go on a hunt of his own. However, unlike many sheep hunts they had no scouting or plan in place. This was a true adventure hunt filled with bad weather, beautiful animals, and uncanny good luck. Follow Luke, Austin and Brady on an experience they will never forget.

We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley.
