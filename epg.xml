Host of Angry Planet George Kourounis travels with a variety of experts to bring down huge avalanches in the Rocky Mountains. Ski Patrollers throw hand charges to clear the slopes, the British Columbia Department of Highways uses helicopter bombing and mountaintop mortars to keep the roads safe, and the Canadian Armed Forces fire 105mm howitzers at the mountains to bring down the dangerous snow. Still, there are accidents and fatalities in the mountains. We meet Francois Desroisers, an avalanche burial victim who tells a terrible and tragic tale of a mountain disaster.</desc>

To make sure his new bride is on the same adventurous page with him, he proposes to get married on the lip of an exploding volcano, on the South Pacific island of Tanna, in Vanuatu. Before the native preacher, dressed in grass skirt and kustom garb, gets to perform the smoky vows, George descends into the erupting volcano to bring out red hot samples of the lava it is producing.</desc>
