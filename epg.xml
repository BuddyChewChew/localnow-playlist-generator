    <desc lang="en">Good morning, everyone! Over the past few weeks, we've been soaking up the sun at Parer's Resort, nestled above Bishop, California, in the stunning Eastern Sierras. Our adventure kicked off with some thrilling pocket creek fishing. We then made our way to South Lake, where we spent a fantastic afternoon with Jared on the pontoon boat. Today, we're kicking off our adventure in the breathtaking surroundings of Lake Sabrina with Seth and Jared. We're venturing into the backcountry for a scenic hike to Long Lake—a first for us in this slice of paradise. Get ready for an unforgettable journey, as we're stoked on trout. Let's go fishing</desc>

We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley. I promise you, this is an ending to a show you won't want to miss. Ryan got a big one; Ryan got a big one!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ken Shamrock’s Iron Man competition comes to a head as two contestants battle it out for the number one spot. Every strike, every takedown matters—because only one can walk away crowned the victor. But there’s no time to celebrate. It’s mission day. After a quick live-fire break, the team receives critical intel from the ISR daylight crew. The risk spikes as night falls and the mission is suddenly altered, forcing the contestants to adapt on the fly. With Red Cat providing coordination from above, the squad is redeployed under new marching orders and even higher stakes. A partially compromised team makes survival uncertain, but when the moment of truth arrives, the team leader takes decisive action—leading a direct breach on the target. One bold decision shifts the course of the mission entirely, and its success now hangs by a thread.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With the mission complete, the contestants think the season is winding down—but HQ has other plans. Their once-fabricated cover story becomes reality, pulling them into a pulse-pounding new challenge designed to test strength, coordination, and mastery of weaponry. This hybrid competition pushes every skill to the limit, weeding out all but the most well-rounded tactical athletes. Along the way, the legendary Don Mann shares his own backstory, giving rare insight into the life and mindset of the man behind the mission. When the dust settles, only one competitor will rise above the rest—earning the title of the season’s most complete warrior.</desc>
