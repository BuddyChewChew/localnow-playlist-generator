Its original score, also composed and performed by the students, will have you tapping your feet as you root for the Knights.

Today, he shifted his career to being behind the scenes as a Story Producer for AAA, the top wrestling company in Lucha Libre. Hodgkinson intimately peels back the curtain on the mysteries of this show, how it’s produced, and what life is like on and off the stage. We dive deep in to the lives of two wrestlers and follow their stories as they prep for their next fight: El Hijo Del Fantasma, an up and coming star who seemingly has it all, as well as Faby Apache, a veteran female wrestler struggling to stay relevant as she raises her son.</desc>
