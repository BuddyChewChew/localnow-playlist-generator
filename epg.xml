    <desc lang="en">In this episode, we dive into how we are using our knowledge and experience to not only get some amazing hunting property, but to have other people pay for it. Sound too good to be true? 

We also take you on some great hunts we’ve had on our journey flipping land and think back on some memories from the past and what the future is going to look like. 

We hope you can learn a thing or two in this episode and encourage you to reach out with any questions you may have about this process.</desc>

Also joining the crew is one of Slade’s real estate clients and his son. Part of the deal when this client worked with Slade was that Slade lined them up an elk hunt the following fall. It is an amazing week at camp with five arrows being sent down range and multiple elk hitting the dirt. You do not want to miss this one.</desc>
