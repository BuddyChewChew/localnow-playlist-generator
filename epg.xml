    <desc lang="en">Master filmmaker Sidney Lumet (The Verdict, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) delivers "one of his greatest achievements" (Roger Ebert) with this riveting and compelling suspense thriller. Oscar®-winner* Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote) is Andy, an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke, Training Day), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering clash that may obliterate their already precarious lives.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Oakmont isn’t just one of the most historic courses in golf — it’s home to one of the most exclusive clubhouses in American sports. 

Ahead of the 125th U.S. Open Championship, we step inside the walls of Oakmont Country Club — a place steeped in U.S. Open history, whispered legends, and decades of golf’s most iconic moments. From the original locker room that held Hogan’s shoes to the trophies that shaped golf’s golden era, this is a rare look at the soul of championship golf.

Last week, Ryan, Dixie, and I embarked on a six-hour road trip to Bishop, California, with a short 45-minute drive up the mountain to Parcher's Resort. After settling into our comfortable cabin, we kicked off our adventure with some creek fishing. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're headed to South Lake to fish with Jared, owner and operator of Parcher's Resort and Sierra Slammer Trout Baits. We'll hop on one of his pontoon boats for a three-hour afternoon session.</desc>
