She gets an apartment that's above a coffee house where she befriends one of the workers, Aram, a guy whose wife only married him so she could get a green card.

Soon after moving into the apartment, Sandy hires Aram to be her nanny while she takes on work for the first time since her children were born. It isn't long when Aram and Sandy find they get along wonderfully and start to date. But the question is: is their relationship real or is it, in fact, just a rebound for both of them?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What a journey it's been over the last three weeks! We kicked off our adventure in Eastern Sears Creek, making our first casts to see what the waters would yield. From there, we headed to South Lake for some laid-back pontoon trout fishing. After a relaxing day by the lake, complete with apple pie and cold beverages, we followed expert advice from Jared to venture back into the heart of nature. Our trek led us to Long Lake, nestled just above South Lake, offering more stunning views and fishing spots. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're picking up where we left off. We'll dive deeper into understanding the lakes, figuring out what the rainbow and brook trout are biting on, and trying our best to land a few. Join us as our backcountry adventure continues</desc>

Last week, Ryan, Dixie, and I embarked on a six-hour road trip to Bishop, California, with a short 45-minute drive up the mountain to Parcher's Resort. After settling into our comfortable cabin, we kicked off our adventure with some creek fishing. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're headed to South Lake to fish with Jared, owner and operator of Parcher's Resort and Sierra Slammer Trout Baits. We'll hop on one of his pontoon boats for a three-hour afternoon session.</desc>
