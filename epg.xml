    <desc lang="en">Definitely our wildest episode so far. Here’s the deal: Mt. Elgon is an 14,000 foot volcano in eastern Kenya.  We propose a safari/ascent of the dormant volcano.

For millennia elephants have been going into the cave to carve it out with their tusks in order to eat the salty rock. Here’s the second kicker: the cave is thought to be the home of the Ebola Marberg virus – the world’s most deadly virus. So here’s the plan: We are going enter the cave, at night, wearing full Bio-Hazard suits to protect us from the virus.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The path to mission readiness takes a sharp turn as contestants are introduced to the Cupolster—an innovative holster system that changes the game when seconds matter. Don delivers a critical safety lesson before the team puts the gear to the test, running a demanding course of fire from inside a truck. From standard draws to Cupolster drills, every move is about speed, precision, and survival under pressure. The action escalates with a SAR9 passenger-seat course of fire that leaves contestants breathless —proving that combat can come from anywhere, at any time. But the real trial begins when Ken Shamrock unleashes his legendary Iron Man challenge. In three-minute elimination rounds, contestants go toe-to-toe against each other, testing not only strength but everything they’ve absorbed under Shamrock’s punishing guidance. It’s survival of the fittest—where only the toughest, sharpest, and most disciplined will walk away victorious.</desc>
