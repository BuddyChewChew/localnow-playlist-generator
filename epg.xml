    <title lang="en">The Decline Of Western Civilization</title>
    <desc lang="en">Penelope Spheeris' The Decline Of Western Civilization is a riveting, unflinching and hard-core film which adeptly captures the spirit of a major cultural phenomenon. Including performances by X, Circle Jerks, Black Flag, Catholic Discipline, Germs and Alice Bag Band. Breaking down barriers of expression and social mores, the Decline punks were against everything: They gave birth to an anti-establishment view of the world that permeates today's music, politics, social attitudes, styles and trends. The film documents their deliberate reaction to the mass commercialism of music; it is a blatant and angry rejection of the mainstream. Burgeoning at the time, many of the punk bands first seen here have become legendary. The effect of the film on current day music, styles and trends is immeasurable.</desc>
