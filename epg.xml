    <desc lang="en">Behind closed doors scientists and corporations have breached genetic codes that separate the individuality of all animal and plant species on earth. Laboratories around the world are honing their skills while our humanity and dignity as a species is on the operating table like a universal Frankenstein, subject to a wholesale psychic and physiological re-design under the guise of progress.  The proponents claim the field of "Transhumanism" will change the world by eliminating sickness and famine while at the same time, governments and military groups around the globe are having clandestine meetings to discuss super soldiers, super intelligence, and even super animals to maintain military dominance and control over the populations of the world. Even more horrifying they must create committees to implement plans to defend their nations against future terrorism performed by transhumans (modified human beings) with the universal understanding that no nation can afford NOT to engage in this apocalyptic future of genetically altered life. We are at war for the mind of a generation and the soul of the human race. Billions of dollars are at stake with corporations and powerful individuals looking toward a post human future world. If we care about our humanity, then the time is NOW to stand up and understand where science and technology are taking us and to do something about it. Our foods are already being genetically altered with devastating side effects which are now coming to light. Will we allow experiments with genetic engineering to excel to a horrifying level where they create an unthinkable race of non-human entities? What level of horrifying abominations have already been committed?</desc>

Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc>

Ahead of the 125th U.S. Open Championship, we step inside the walls of Oakmont Country Club — a place steeped in U.S. Open history, whispered legends, and decades of golf’s most iconic moments. From the original locker room that held Hogan’s shoes to the trophies that shaped golf’s golden era, this is a rare look at the soul of championship golf.

    <desc lang="en"> Matt is out for revenge. Last year Dale beat him badly at the Annual Vintage bike race in Barber, Alabama. But this year there is a whole new tale to tell. With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt&amp;#39;s prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don&amp;#39;t tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>

It utilized aircraft tubing, Corvette disc brakes, and a Chevy truck differential to keep it stable. The one-off creation disappeared when Gelbke did in 1978. Outflanked once when the bike was spotted and sold to a private collector in 1995, Dale has vowed to locate the machine and make Wheels Through Time its final resting place.</desc>
