    <desc lang="en">This episode kicks off inside the headquarters of Law Enforcement Specialists, where their mission is clear: Prevent. Protect. Respond. From their signed officer wall to their welcoming space for first responders, Bonnie and her team are on the front lines for those who serve. We also get an inside look at their groundbreaking Blue Dispatch software, helping departments streamline jobs and response times. Next, the A-Team travels to Naples, Florida, to celebrate the grand opening of David Beavis’ newest gallery, where his breathtaking photography delivers a powerful message of God’s love and the beauty of creation. Then, Eric Couch of Provision Brokerage shows how his company protects seniors’ “safe money” and builds retirement security for the long haul. Finally, we visit the Connected &amp; Protected call center with president Adam Marsh, where their team makes it simple for seniors to stay safe with innovative, easy-to-use technology.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It’s time to break down what the A-Team has learned from our latest group of companies—and how we can best support them in reaching their goals. Today, the spotlight is on A-Team member Larry Ward of Market Rithm. This seasoned CEO has seen it all when it comes to marketing strategy—and he’s got the accolades to prove it. Now, he’s setting his sights on helping businesses gain a competitive edge in their marketing efforts. Next, we’re introduced to another powerhouse on Kevin’s team: Nate Bailey, founder of Unleash the Leader Within. Nate brings a dynamic, personalized approach to scaling businesses that have often been overlooked. Rounding out this insightful roundtable discussion are A-Team members Chandler Kline from PICMII Crowdfunding and podcaster Dr. Jason Dean, each contributing their own unique areas of expertise.</desc>

Watch how these dedicated Americans are giving back to their fellow patriots in a big way. Fair warning—Mark’s work at Valor Clinic is a true tearjerker. Next, we take a quick trip to the tropics to catch Aggressor Adventures in action. Kyle Reyes checks in with owner Wayne for an update on how he’s been implementing the A-Team’s sage advice. After saying goodbye to Wayne, the team visits another incredible destination to reconnect with the founders of STAYCA VACAY. To wrap things up, Kyle Reyes stops by Compliant Technologies to experience their innovative product firsthand. And of course, we wouldn’t leave without a live demo of their shockingly advanced invention—The G.L.O.V.E.</desc>
