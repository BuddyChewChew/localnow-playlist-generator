    <title lang="en">Angel Maker: Serial Killer Queen</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the 19th century, England controlled the biggest Empire the world had ever seen. Scientific breakthroughs, huge scale engineering, and great leaps in medicine led Britain's reign of global power. And yet, behind the facade there was a darkness. An unimaginable world of evil - theft, rape, murder and more. This was the real world of Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes. But there was a lesser known killer on the loose who was far worse than any of the others, a woman who would succeed in becoming one of the world's most prolific serial killers. Her name was Amelia Dyer and she killed over 400 innocent babies.  A seemingly gentle old lady, Amelia would take in children under the guise of nurturing and caring for them when in reality she starved and strangled them to death. Explore inconceivable recesses of humanity in this shockingly true story of human darkness and depravity at the turn of the century.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The ultimate in actress exploitation, Scream Queen Killer takes you on a journey into the world of indie grindhouse film auditions with a mind bending twist. Anna is a young actress desperate to make it in the movies. She is invited to a series of filmed auditions, playing out various scenarios on camera. The problem is, the director is a perverted psychopath with only one thing on his mind. As Anna progresses through an ever more bizarre series of roles she slowly realizes that something is horribly wrong with this audition. Forced to strip and perform carnal acts in the name of the art, she eventually flips and takes matters into her own hands. A scenario many actresses may recognize in the industry, Scream Queen Killer is brutally realistic and superbly acted by Melanie Denholme (Lady of the Dark). How far is too far? And how far would you go to get the role?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this episode we’re headed down to the fishing village of Shell Beach in St. Bernard Parish for a full Louisiana experience!
Joining us is Chef Lynnae Oxley, a chef from the Pacific Northwest who once beat our own Jay Ducote on Food Network’s Chopped.
On the way, we make a pit stop at the iconic Abita Brewery on Tchoupitoulas in New Orleans, then grab lunch and cook up some classic hog’s head cheese at Jeanfreau’s Meat Market.
From there, it’s all about the water — trout and redfish with Captain Don, crawfish and crabs with Captain Sal, followed by the ultimate Louisiana feast as we cook up our fresh catch at the Gotcha Hooked Lodge’s outdoor kitchen.
It’s fishing, food, and culture — served up Bayou style!

With tensions in the Middle East reaching a boiling point, the CIA assigns the All-Stars an executive protection mission for a key negotiator.
