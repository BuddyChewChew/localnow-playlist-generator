    <desc lang="en">The A-Team gets back to work—this time diving into cross-marketing strategies for Advanced Vitality. Over at Hammer Haag, the team discusses launching a gritty new “Micro Dirty Jobs” miniseries to spotlight American manufacturing in action. We’re also introduced to serial entrepreneur Jeff Kline, founder of 1-800-Medigap, who brings a powerhouse presence to the team’s growing roster. Meanwhile, Cindy from Scout &amp; Zoe’s returns for a full brand overhaul with the experts. Newest A-Team member Rudy Mawer steps in with high-level influencer insight and a mission to empower the next generation of entrepreneurs.

    <desc lang="en">Tim Harmsen trains at Summit Point, testing rapid-fire shooting and vehicle combat tactics. At Fort Sumter, he reflects on the Civil War’s legacy with a 100-gun salute. Then it’s off to Avidity Arms, where Rob Pincus joins him to explore real-world home defense. From tactical holsters to high-speed vehicle drills, Tim puts it all to the test in a live-fire evolution under pressure.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this episode of Wild Shots, Tim Harmsen heads to the heart of American gun craftsmanship with an exclusive, behind-the-scenes tour of Palmetto State Armory, where freedom is literally built on the production floor. From the anodizing line to live assembly, Tim witnesses American ingenuity in action as a rifle comes to life before his eyes. With the epic 10,000-Round Challenge complete, it’s time for some serious maintenance. The crew at SEAL 1 steps in with their cutting-edge nanotechnology to give the battle-worn BCM AK the deep clean it deserves. Once the guns are gleaming, it’s time to send rounds downrange. Teaming up with top firearms influencer Sootch, Tim takes aim at a new challenge, including a 1,000-yard Wild Shot that pushes precision, patience, and performance to the limit.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The stakes continue to climb as Green Light Sights rewards one top shooter with their very own custom weapon—proof that precision pays off. But there's no time to celebrate. Bear Arms ups the ante by issuing defense vests to every contestant, with one hard rule: once it’s on, it stays on. From grueling mission briefings to body armor plank challenges that push endurance to the brink, the weight—literally and mentally—never lets up. Still armored, the team reports to Ken Shamrock for another brutal dose of Lion’s Den physical punishment. Just when they think they’ve caught a break, Compliant Technologies’ infamous glove makes a shocking return to torment a fresh round of contestants. And as the day winds down, Don introduces the team to his personal “Flights” challenge—an unforgiving test no one is excited to take on. It all ends with a sobering CIA reminder: in the field, your backstory might just save your life—or end it.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surviving Mann</title>
    <desc lang="en">This week, memory meets mission as contestants face off in a high-stakes Kim’s Game challenge—designed to sharpen recall under pressure with 100 points and team leadership on the line. With observation, speed, and accuracy all in play, remembering every detail could make or break the mission. As the team pushes forward, it’s time to dig deeper. Contestants open up about their backstories, revealing the powerful personal reasons that brought them to the toughest reality show on earth. Some are here to prove something. Others? To fight for more than just themselves. The action intensifies as Hoffner Knives returns with a brutal tactical evolution, testing shooting and blade skills with precision under pressure. A split-second difference determines the winner of a major reward—proving that in this game, every tenth of a second matters. The day wraps with a visit from HCA Precision Barrels and one final classroom lesson—a pointed reminder that in the world of elite operators, your story is your strength… or your downfall.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"Hope you're hungry. In this episode, come along as we eat our weight in sushi and ramen, meet nori farmers and wagyu ranchers, and make some new surfing buddies along the way. P.S. if you're hungry for more Japan content, stay tuned for our next two episodes.

In this episode of DIRT, the crew road tripped around Kyushu. The food culture in Kyushu dates back to the emperors of Japan, and the Black Current off the eastern shore has shaped the island's cuisine for centuries. The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors. And with each stop, we learned even more about how the traditions we keep can honor thousands of years of knowledge—and point the way to the future."</desc>
